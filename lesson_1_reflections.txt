How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparing each line of the old file that was modified
    as seen in the new file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps me to save time when debugging

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: with git you can have a history of changes of your code
    Cons: it takes more space and with more changes you will have a lot of past files; you can confuse
    Pros: automatic saving reduces space
    Cons: you can not track your changes in the code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make money and offer a better solution

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I haven't use them yet. When it happens you will be the first motherfucker to know it

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can back up what was working and delete what not

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To practice
