Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to clone a repository inside GitHub. Clone is needed to copy repositories from GitHub to your pc or to clone repositories between local pcs. A branch is a commit that outlines the previous commits with special features. Depending on your application, you will use each of these.
